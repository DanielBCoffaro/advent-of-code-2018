# Advent of code


This is all of my solutions for Advent of code 2017. "Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels... Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme."

Most folders contain two .py files. One for the first challenge, and one for the second. On certain days this didn't make sense so there is only one. There are also input files in many of the folders. Each folder also contains the challenge for part one and two.
